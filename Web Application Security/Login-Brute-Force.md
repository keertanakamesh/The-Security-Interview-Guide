Brute-force attacks on a login page involve attackers systematically trying different username-password combinations until they gain unauthorized access. To prevent such attacks, you should implement multiple layers of security controls at different levels. Below are various methods categorized by approach:

1. Rate Limiting & Lockout Mechanisms
   
1.1 Rate Limiting

Implement IP-based rate limiting (e.g., allow only a certain number of login attempts per minute per IP).
Use CAPTCHA after a certain number of failed login attempts to distinguish humans from bots.
Introduce progressive delays (e.g., after 5 failed attempts, introduce a 5-second delay, then 10 seconds, etc.).

1.2 Account Lockout & Timeout

Temporarily lock accounts after a set number of failed attempts (e.g., after 5 consecutive failed logins, lock for 15 minutes).
Implement incremental lockouts (e.g., increasing lockout duration with each successive failed attempt).
Send an email/SMS notification to the user when an account lockout occurs.

2. Strong Authentication Mechanisms
   
2.1 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Require MFA for login, such as TOTP-based (Google Authenticator, Authy) or FIDO2/WebAuthn-based authentication.
Implement adaptive authentication (e.g., requiring MFA only if login is from a new device, location, or suspicious behavior detected).

2.2 Passwordless Authentication

Use passkeys/WebAuthn, which rely on device-based authentication rather than traditional passwords.
Implement magic links or one-time passcodes sent via email or SMS instead of passwords.

3. Password Security & User Input Controls

3.1 Strong Password Policies

Enforce strong password requirements (e.g., a minimum of 12-16 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
Prevent the use of common or breached passwords by checking against databases like Have I Been Pwned.

3.2 Account Enumeration Prevention

Use generic error messages (e.g., “Invalid username or password” instead of specifying which one is incorrect).
Implement username enumeration protection by using the same response time for valid and invalid users.

4. Network & Infrastructure Protections

4.1 Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Use a WAF (e.g., AWS WAF, Cloudflare, Fastly) to detect and block automated brute-force attacks.
Configure rules to detect excessive failed logins and block suspicious traffic patterns.

4.2 IP & Geo-Blocking

Block known malicious IP addresses or use threat intelligence feeds to identify bad actors.
Implement geo-blocking if users are expected from a limited number of regions.

5. Behavioral & AI-Based Protections

5.1 Device Fingerprinting & Anomaly Detection

Use device fingerprinting to track login attempts from different devices.
Deploy AI-based anomaly detection to identify unusual login behavior, such as multiple failed attempts from different geolocations.

5.2 Risk-Based Authentication

If a login attempt is flagged as risky (e.g., login from a new country or unknown device), enforce additional verification like MFA.

6. Logging & Monitoring

6.1 Security Logging

Log all login attempts, including IP addresses, user agents, and timestamps.
Store logs securely and monitor for patterns of brute-force attempts.

6.2 Alerting & Incident Response

Set up alerts for high failure rates (e.g., 100 failed logins in 10 minutes).
Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., SIEM, AWS GuardDuty, Splunk) to detect and respond to brute-force attempts in real time.

7. Honeypots & Deception Techniques

Deploy fake login endpoints to detect and trap automated attacks.
Use honeypot accounts with monitoring to flag brute-force attempts.
