# Application Security Interview Questions

## Setting up the context
You can assess yourself by checking how many of these application security interview questions are easy for you, how many need finetuning and how many are yet to learn and master. Remember, every one of us is learning and a question is easy for you doesn’t mean it’s the same for everyone. However, it depends upon the role, and expectations set by the hiring manager and the interviewer.

The question might look straightforward but your answer speaks more about your experience and hands-on in this domain. Try to analyze the question and answer honestly. 

Many questions might not be for your experience or role as I am sharing mixed questions asked for various roles in the Application Security domain. 

Also, I am not sharing questions on any programming language-specific or even programming-based security questions. That can possibly be another series of questions in my next release.

### First thing first
This interview question set is mostly for defensive roles as compared to offensive roles which are mainly called “Penetration Testing or Web Security (sometimes it’s used interchangeably) ”. I will concentrate more on how an application is developed, maintained, and deployed and how as a security engineer you would help an engineering team to overcome security challenges.


### Second important note
I am listing questions based on a few criteria:

1. Common to everyone who is in this domain or trying to enter this domain.
2. Some questions would be theoretical and you can consider those questions as a starting point to check the candidate’s overall knowledge
3. Some questions are for senior professionals
4. Some questions may have different answers depending on seniority level
5. Some questions can be to check your domain and leadership skills in this domain

**_One more thing_**

If you are new to this domain or planning to make a career in cybersecurity. You should see the study plan before delving into interview questions.

__They are:__

1. [Common Skills Study Plan](https://jassics.medium.com/study-plan-to-learn-common-skills-in-cybersecurity-865d15e28c46) that you can finish within 3 months
2. [20 Essential books that you should read from security world](https://jassics.medium.com/20-essential-books-for-every-security-pros-journey-cfba7033bb1c)
3. [Application Security Study Plan](https://github.com/jassics/security-study-plan/blob/main/application-security-study-plan.md) (You must go through it before trying for appsec interviews)
4. You can’t ignore API security at present. So, here is your [API Security Study Plan](https://github.com/jassics/security-study-plan/blob/main/api-security-study-plan.md)
5. Knowledge of Pentest will be an added advantage for you. Check this out: [Web Pentest Study Plan](https://github.com/jassics/security-study-plan/blob/main/web-pentest-study-plan.md)
6. You can star or bookmark [Security Study Plan](https://github.com/jassics/security-study-plan) which will give you an insight into what to study for various security domains.

## This space will focus more on:

1. Secure Code Review
2. Threat Modeling
3. Secure Coding
4. Secure Development
5. And anything that is defensive in nature and developer centric. For everything else related to [web security we have another page](web-security-interview-questions.md).

If you are interviewing someone for Application Security Engineer role, could be juinor, senior or architect level.
You can always start questions based on the person's experience in AppSec. However, below questions can be always interesting and will help you to understand the candidate better technically.
Soft skills, team player, presentation skills, communication skills are out of the scope of this space.

### Application Security Scenario-based interview questions
Consider this section as the toughest one and mainly for senior appsec professional.

1. How would you design a safe and secure password mechanism?
2. Can you explain the password hashing function and the importance of salt? Also, how salting and hashing passwords are used in this domain?
3. You use the SCA tool to find vulnerabilities in 3rd party libraries. How would you mitigate those vulnerabilities found and risks associated with third-party libraries and frameworks?
4. Your company is developing a new financial application that handles sensitive customer data, including banking information. Describe how you would approach threat modeling for this application. What specific threats would you consider, and how would you prioritize and mitigate them?
5. You are tasked with performing a secure code review for a web application that has been recently developed. During the review, you find several instances where user inputs are directly concatenated into SQL queries. Explain how you would address this issue and guide the development team to implement a secure solution.
6. A development team is working on a new feature that requires handling and storing user passwords. They plan to use a simple hash function (e.g., MD5) to store these passwords. As a security architect, how would you advise them on securely handling and storing passwords? Provide a detailed explanation of best practices.
7. During a code review, you discover that the application does not properly handle errors and exceptions. For example, stack traces are exposed to end users, which could potentially reveal sensitive information. Describe how you would rectify this situation and implement secure error handling and logging practices.
8. A critical vulnerability is discovered in a third-party library used extensively in your company’s application. Explain the process you would follow to assess the impact, communicate with stakeholders, and implement a fix. How would you prevent similar issues in the future?

10. How would you review an architecture to prevent an automated brute force attack or dictionary attack (think of different brute force attack techniques)?

### Secure Code Review round with code snippets
Many companies won’t have this round, but I feel one should involve a few code snippets in an interview to check the candidate’s indirect coding knowledge from security point of view, at least for a senior role like a lead or staff role. 

Insecure code snippets can be on a tougher note. However, I am adding a few easy ones for practice and to give an idea of how this round can be prepared well as per the JD.

I would give you a hint for your practice, but in an interview, you won’t be given any hint.

1. Identify the security issue in this code snippet and explain how you would fix it. [Hint: Can you spot the CSRF issue here?]
```php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $userId = $_POST['userId'];
    $newEmail = $_POST['newEmail'];
    updateEmail($userId, $newEmail);
}
```

2. Identify the security issue in this code snippet and explain how you would fix it. [Hint: Insecure desrialization]

```java
ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("data.ser"));
Object obj = in.readObject();
in.close();
```
3. Identify the security issue in this code snippet and explain how you would fix it. [Hint: password hashing issue]

```python
import hashlib
def store_password(password):
    hashed_password = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
    save_to_database(hashed_password)
```    
4. Which security issue it can cause? [Hint: XSS]

```typescript
const userInput = request.query.userInput;
const output = "<div>" + userInput + "</div>";
response.send(output);
```
5. Most common question asked in a secure coding round. It doesn’t need a hint I suppose. What issue this code snippet would cause and how would you help the developer in fixing it?

```javascript
String userId = request.getParameter("userId");
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = '" + userId + "'";
Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
```

## Topics or concepts that are subjective and can check your in-depth knowledge regarding that area
### 1. What do you think about the good password?
    
This question looks very similar, but can help the interviewer to understand if the person has experience with password management related skills or not. 
    
This question will help you to drill down to more specific questions to understand the competence of the candidate:
   1. What is complex password
   2. Should the password complexity be same for admin and user
   3. How do you save the password in Database, encrypted or hashed or plain text
